# team_dave_v2.0

This remote control app is made for the 2017 [MIT PPAT](http://ppat.mit.edu/fall2017/index.html) Team Dave project. 
It is formatted for a 9.7-inch iPad, but should also work on other iPad versions.

Once installing the app, you must set the IP and Email in settings. 
The IP is the IP address of the wifi that the Arduino is running on. Email defines the email that will receive the new IP address
whenever the Arduino connects to a new wifi network.

You must also define your own preset channels on the preset page, as they are not initially set.

[Follow this link](https://github.com/jrp27/ppat-dave-arduino) for instructions on the TV/Arduino integration with this app.
